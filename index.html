            <p>Hello! My name is Rachel Lagoudakis and I am from Queensland, Australia. I enjoy homesteading, travelling and spending time in nature. 
                I was raised in New Zealand, but Australia is my home. We have three children, two dogs, two cats and numberless concourses of chickens.
                I love to bake sourdough bread, cook food from scratch, lift weights and serve as the Young Women's President for our local ward. If you have 
                read this far I appreciate your effort, however you will notice that this paragraph is now a bunch of hog-wash since my end-goal is really to
                fill this space in relation to the image you see to the right, that was taken in my kitchen. Thanks for stopping by! I hope this wasn't too 
                tedious for you. 
                This line has been added here to take up space. "As you were."
            </p>
